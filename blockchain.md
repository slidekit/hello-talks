# The Proof of the Pudding is ...  The Bitcoin (BTC) Blockchain(s)

A Success Story on the Blockchain.

May 22, 2010 - World's 1st Bitcoin Payment

A developer bought two pizzas using 10 000 Bitcoin (BTC) - a then-little-known digital (crypto)currency.
Estimated worth about $40.

Triva Q: How much is one Bitcoin worth today? Q: How much are 10 000 Bitcoin worth today?

# Code, Code, Code - A Blockchain in JavaScript in 20 Lines! A Blockchain is a Data Structure

What's Blockchain?

It's a list (chain) of blocks linked and secured by digital fingerprints (also known as
crypto hashes).


```
const SHA256 = require( "js-sha256" )     // for hash checksum digest function SHA256

class Block {

  constructor(index, data, previousHash) {
    this.index        = index
    this.timestamp    = new Date()
    this.data         = data
    this.previousHash = previousHash
    this.hash         = this.calcHash()
  }

  calcHash() {
    var sha = SHA256.create()
    sha.update( this.index.toString() +
                this.timestamp.toString() +
                this.data +
                this.previousHash )
    return sha.hex()
  }
```

(Source: [openblockchains/awesome-blockchains/blockchain.js](https://github.com/openblockchains/awesome-blockchains/blob/master/blockchain.js/blockchain.js))

Yes, that's it.



# Code, Code, Code - A Blockchain in JavaScript in 20 Lines! A Blockchain is a Data Structure (Cont.)

Let's add two helpers (`first`, `next`) for building ("mining") blocks.

```
class Block {
  ...
  static first( data="Genesis" ) {    // create genesis (big bang! first) block
    // uses index zero (0) and arbitrary previousHash ("0")
    return new Block( 0, data, "0" )
  }

  static next( previous, data="Transaction Data..." ) {
    return new Block( previous.index+1, data, previous.hash )
  }
}
```

(Source: [openblockchains/awesome-blockchains/blockchain.js](https://github.com/openblockchains/awesome-blockchains/blob/master/blockchain.js/blockchain.js))

Let's get started -  build a blockchain a block at a time!

```
b0 = Block.first( "Genesis" )
b1 = Block.next( b0, "Transaction Data..." )
b2 = Block.next( b1, "Transaction Data......" )
b3 = Block.next( b2, "More Transaction Data..." )

blockchain = [b0, b1, b2, b3]

console.log( blockchain )
```


# Code, Code, Code - A Blockchain in JavaScript in 20 Lines! A Blockchain is a Data Structure (Cont.)

> Wait, so a blockchain is just a linked list?
>
> No. A linked list is only required to have a reference to the previous element,
> a block must have an identifier depending on the previous block's identifier,
> meaning that you cannot replace a block without recomputing every single block that comes after.
> In this implementation that happens as the previous digest is input in the calc_hash method.


will log something like:

```
[ Block {
      index: 0,
      timestamp: 2017-09-18T08:25:54,
      data: 'Genesis',

```

The computer (node) in the blockchain network that computes the
next block with a valid hash wins the lottery?

For adding a block to the chain you get a reward! You get 25 Bitcoin! (†)

Bitcoin adds a block every ten minutes.

(†) The reward gets halfed. In Sep'17 you'll get 12.5 Bitcoin.



# What about Proof-of-Work? What about Consensus? (Cont.)

Random SHA256 hash #1: `c396de4c03ddb5275661982adc75ce5fc5905d2a2457d1266c74436c1f3c50f1`

Random SHA256 hash #2: `493131e09c069645c82795c96e4715cea0f5558be514b5096d853a5b9899154a`

Triva Q: What's SHA256?

- (A) Still Hacking Anyway
- (B) Secure Hash Algorithm
- (C) Sweet Home Austria
- (D) Super High Aperture


# What about Proof-of-Work? What about Consensus? (Cont.)

A: SHA256 == Secure Hash Algorithms 256 Bits

Trivia: Designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States of America (USA).

Secure == Random  e.g. Change one Letter and the Hash will Change Completely

Making (Hash) Mining a Lottery - Find the Lucky Number

Find a hash that starts with ten leading zeros e.g.

`0000000000069645c82795c96e4715cea0f5558be514b5096d853a5b9899154a`

Hard to compute! Easy to check / validate.



# What about Proof-of-Work? What about Consensus? (Cont.)

Making (Hash) Mining a Lottery - Find the Lucky Number (Nonce)

```
computeHashWithProofOfWork( difficulty="00" ) {
    var nonce = 0
    while( true ) {
      var hash = this.calcHashWithNonce( nonce )
      if( hash.startsWith( difficulty ))
        return nonce, hash    // bingo! proof of work if hash starts with leading zeros (00)
      else
        nonce += 1            // keep trying (and trying and trying)
    }
}

calcHashWithNonce( nonce=0 ) {
    var sha = SHA256.create()
    sha.update( nonce.toString() +
                this.index.toString() +
                this.timestamp.toString() +
                this.data +
                this.previousHash )
    return sha.hex()
}

# The World's Worst Database - Bitcoin Blockchain Mining

- Uses approximately the same amount of electricity as could power an average American household
  for a day per transaction
- Supports 3 transactions / second across a global network with millions of CPUs/purpose-built ASICs
- Takes over 10 minutes to "commit" a transaction
- Doesn't acknowledge accepted writes: requires you read your writes,
  but at any given time you may be on a blockchain fork, meaning your write might not actually
  make it into the "winning" fork of the blockchain (and no, just making it into the mempool doesn't count).
  In other words: "blockchain technology" cannot by definition tell you if a given write is ever
  accepted/committed except by reading it out of the blockchain itself (and even then)
- Can only be used as a transaction ledger denominated in a single currency,
  or to store/timestamp a maximum of 80 bytes per transaction

# What's Blockchain Lite - JavaScript Edition?  

blockchain-lite library / module (npm: [`blockchain-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blockchain-lite)) -
build your own blockchain with crypto hashes -
revolutionize the world with blockchains, blockchains, blockchains one block at a time

**Usage**

Let's get started.  Build your own blockchain one block at a time.
Example:

``` js
const Blocks = require( "blockchain-lite" )

// use basic block
let Block = Blocks.basic

let b0 = Block.first( 'Genesis' )
let b1 = Block.next( b0, 'Transaction Data...' )
let b2 = Block.next( b1, 'Transaction Data......' )
let b3 = Block.next( b2, 'More Transaction Data...' )

let blockchain = [b0, b1, b2, b3]

console.log( blockchain )
```
