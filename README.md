#  Talks Starter (S6 Blank)

Write your talks / presentations / slides in plain text
w/ markdown formatting conventions.

Ready-to-use (fork/clone) minimal setup - uses the [jekyll talks theme](https://github.com/slidekit/jekyll-talks-theme)
(using the s6 slideshow templates / machinery ) via the new remote-theme.



## Usage

Add a new page e.g [`starter.md`](starter.md).
Change the layout to `talk` in the front matter (meta data) block to
"automagically" turn your notes in plain text with markdown formatting conventions
into HTML slide (using the S6 blank templates and bespoke.js-compatible slideshow machinery).
Example:


``` yaml
---
title:     Your Title Here
author:    Your Name Here
date:      November 11, 2017

layout:    talk
---
```


Use heading 1s `#` or heading 2s `##` for starting new slides. Example:


```
# In the morning

## Getting up

- Turn off alarm
- Get out of bed

## Breakfast

- Eat eggs
- Drink coffee


# In the evening

## Dinner

- Eat spaghetti
- Drink wine
- Browse slide show

## Going to sleep

- Get in bed
- Count sheep
```

That's it.
