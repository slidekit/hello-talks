#  Talk Starter (S6 Blank)

Write your talks / presentations / slides in plain text
w/ markdown formatting conventions.

Ready-to-use (fork/clone) minamal setup - uses the [jekyll talks theme](https://github.com/slidekit/jekyll-talks-theme)
(using the s6 slideshow templates / machinery ) via the new remote-theme.



## Usage

Add a new markdown page e.g `sample.md`.
Note: Change the layout to `talk` - will "automagically"
turn your notes into slides and include the S6 blank templates
and slideshow machinery:


``` yaml
---
title:     Your Title Here
author:    Your Name Here
date:      November 11, 2017

layout:    talk
---
```


Use heading 1s `#` or heading 2s `##` for starting new slides. Example:


``` md
# In the morning

## Getting up

- Turn off alarm
- Get out of bed

## Breakfast

- Eat eggs
- Drink coffee


# In the evening

## Dinner

- Eat spaghetti
- Drink wine
- Browse slide show

## Going to sleep

- Get in bed
- Count sheep
```

That's it.
